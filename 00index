This is a cross development C compiler, assembler and linker environment
for the production of 8086 executables (Optionally MSDOS COM)

All you need is in the 'Dev86src-X.Y.Z.tar.gz' file, the others provide only
parts of this or just the binaries.

Dev86src-X.Y.Z.tar.gz           The complete source
as86-X.Y.Z.tar.gz               The assembler source only
bin86-X.Y.Z.tar.gz              The source to the standard 'bin86' package.

Dev86bin-X.Y.Z.tar.gz           Linux-386 ELF binaries (libc6)
Dev86dos-X.Y.Z.zip              Msdos binaries for making COM files.
Dev86clb-X.Y.Z.zip              Libc binaries all the libc archive files
				pre-compiled. (For DOS, minix or any machine
				without GNU make installed)

patch-*.gz                      Patch files, two version numbers mean the
                                patch is between those versions. One means
				it's between X.Y.Z and X.Y.(Z-1).
