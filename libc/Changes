----- Mar 21 '96 - RDB
Add -Md -Mf flags to bcc.c
corrected oops on ../Makefile
Changes to READMEs
----- Mar 18 '96 - RDB
Re-written to wetware storage "Robert must remember to fill in changes!"
Ok, there's now some makefiles in the directory above for creating an
environment with cleanup of bcc/as/ld makefiles and new home for bcc files.
My version of a standard I/O package has been added, I've split the
output libs for Linux-86 and MSDOS.
A couple of functions (including reboot) added to elksemu.
----- Mar  3 '96 - RDB
open/close in doselks
----- Feb 25 '96 - RDB
iota.c - oops -ve numbers give infinite loop
altered a.out.h changed size of n_name from 8 to 24, ld needs recompile,
dis88 bombed (bad malloc), nm etc will need to know.
added popen, pclose, system
----- Feb 24 '96 - RDB
Problem with __lseek syscall, was trying to return a long - no way jose
Little change to malloc1/* if you #define __MINI_MALLOC__ (used in LIB)
a _much_ smaller but more limited version of malloc is used.
Added assert.h - no __assert() in lib yet.
Added in printf c/o Steven Huang <sthuang@hns.com>.
ELKSemu; added -Wall, cleaned up mess.
----- Feb 23 '96 - RDB
Release 0.0.3, bump version to 0.0.4
----- Feb 18 '96 - RDB
ELKSemu signals now seem to be working.
ELKSemu; Added symlinks
ELKSemu; Added opendir support
ELKSemu; now runs as ELF executable
Added exec* functions except exec*p ones
Small cleanup of doselks.
Start final checks for 0.0.3
----- Feb 16 '96 - RDB
I do _NOT_ believe this - sbrk() yet again!! RIGHT! This time it WILL work!!
Groan! There was no problem with sbrk, it was elksemu :-(   fixed!
----- Feb 12 '96 - RDB
Yet another problem with sbrk() return val wrong! - FIXed
Alter elksemu change in way *_tab.v files work.
----- Feb 11 '96 - RDB
Fix on strchr (asm86) - SI not saved
First cut at opendir/readdir/closedir
Move in ar.h
add in 'make config' - (split malloc's and options for stdio packages)
Merge in Nat's grp and other pieces.
ELKSemu; Little i386 kernel patch, i8086 programs now run transparently :-)
----- Feb 10 '96 - RDB
Found a _nasty_ bug with atexit; the actual problem was in cstartup but ...
----- Feb 4 '96 - RDB
Corrected minor problem in atexit/on_exit
----- Jan 28 '96 - RDB
Debug, execve in libc _and_ elksemu
perror added
----- Jan 27 '96 - RDB
Debug pwd, pw_fd was static
Started modifing syscall.dat, adjusting elksemu to match.
----- Jan 21 '96 - RDB
Altered fflush to test return status. Corrected porting bug in printf.c
----- Jan 20 '96 - RDB
Imported printf from the 'DLibs' library, I've now found the rest of the
Dlibs stdio, it appears to be very ST specific tho :-(
NB: This is not in the dist, still sending out Joel's
----- Jan 19 '96 - RDB
Making some test alterations to stdio.
Made ungetc into function, removed ungetc specific structure items
Altered putc() to micro-macro.
----- Jan 16 '96 - RDB
Added in patches from Nat, corrected minor oops in misc/alias.c
----- Jan 11 '96 - RDB
Final checks, release version 0.0.2
----- Jan 9 '96 - RDB
Added 'signal' function. 
Added 'setjmp' Is it right for SI & DI to be saved ?
----- Jan 8 '96 - RDB
Added various MS-DOS functions, COM files are now starting to be able to
do something useful.
----- Jan 7 '96 - RDB
Added the 'New_subdir' script.
Now YOU (Yes I mean you reading this!) can use it :-)
----- Jan 6 '96 - RDB
Problem with sbrk() shown up by Joel's malloc, the error checks failed if
you were allocating big blocks, fixed.
----- Jan 6 '96 - RDB
Added in Joel's malloc routine after a solid hack to actually debug it
it seems to work now but I haven't really tested it; I can't do it under
x386 Linux as something tried to link in 'realloc' too.
----- Jan 5 '96 - RDB
Ok, I've messed around and joined in Joel's stdio.h routines
----- Jan 3 '96 - RDB
(This is a good idea, dates, Always overlook the little things, ho hum!)
----- - RDB
Added 'movedata' function like MSC version to string/string.h
----- - RDB
Added support for the -C-f and -C-c options of BCC. BUT note for the moment
the string functions degenerate to the C versions for -C-f
----- - RDB
Added getenv/putenv
----- - RDB
Changed crt0.c. It now only jmps to ___cstartup. This is so the same crt0
can be used for both DOS and Linux, only the libc needs to be changed.
Cost is 4 bytes at the start of the exe.
----- - RDB
Added support for automatic calling of functions before main. (See Pre_main)
Added support for atexit() and onexit() functions.
----- - RDB
Added fast strchr
Altered strstr to use strchr.
----- - RDB
Added cputype function - CPU detector.
----- - RDB
Dec 12 95
Just completed a working debugged malloc set _including_ a 'fake' alloca
function. (The assembler version will not work for BCC) It's a classical
algorthm so may be slow in some cases. I had a look at the GNU malloc ...
erm ... I _think_ I see what they're doing!  :-)
----- - RDB
Added tiny printf, to be replaced by Joel.
Added HP-UX long->ascii function.
----- - RDB
Split off brk/sbrk etc into own file. Asm alloca not compiled.
