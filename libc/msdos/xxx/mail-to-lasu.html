<h1>Sending mail to Lasu</h1>

<p>I get mail from a lot of people I don't know. Some of this mail is
welcome, some is not. Unwelcome mail annoys me, because I pay for my
Internet connection, and I don't want to pay for something I don't want. 
Even if I didn't pay, unwanted mail still wastes my time, which alone
is bad enough.

<p>
This page explains my mail preferences. I'm grateful if you read it
before sending me mail.

<p><strong>I don't want to receive</strong>:

<ul>
<li> Advertisments I did not ask for.  Making me pay for your ads is
	rude, and possibly illegal.  I react strongly to ads.
<li> Chain letters.  Most of them are illegal.  All of them are a waste
	of network resources.  I react strongly to chain letters.
<li> Mailing lists I did not subscribe to, whether they are for ads or
	not.  I react strongly to this.
<li> Questions about Linux from strangers.  I'm somewhat well
	known in the Linux community, and I often get questions related
	to Linux.  I don't have the time to answer a lot of questions, and
	much of the time I don't even know the answer.  If you send one
	to me, I will probably just ignore it. (This point only applies
	to general questions; I'm happy to discuss my own activities.)
<li> Questions on other things you think I might know, especially including
	Procmail, unless you have reason to believe I'm the only person
	(or one of a small group) able to answer the question.
<li> Anything that is big (more than about 50 kB), in one or more pieces.
	If you want me to have a big file, ask me first.
<li> Privately mailed copies of public responses to my messages on mailing
	lists or in newsgroups. Don't make me pay
	for downloading duplicate copies of the same message or wasting
	my time reading the same message twice.
</ul>

<p><strong>I welcome</strong>: 

<ul>
<li> Anything from friends, relatives, and other people I personally know.
<li> Anything I've specifically asked for, including ads or big files.
<li> Anything concerning something I've written (programs, documents, 
	articles, letters, etc), as long as it related to that.  Replying
	to my article with an unrelated ad invites hostility on my part.
<li> Anything related to comp.os.linux.announce, which I moderate.
<li> Anything related to the Linux Software Map, which I maintain.
<li> Anything concerning one of my other volunteer activities, such 
	as creating new groups in the sfnet hierarchy, or about one of the 
	associations or organizations I'm active in.
<li> Mailing lists I've subscribed to.
</ul> 

<p>If you aren't sure if I'm interested, send me one line and ask me.
Neither of the above lists are exhaustive, and I'm sure there will be
exceptions.

<p>I used to have a mail filter that was quite aggressive and
deleted all mail from unknown people. I've since softened
it quite a bit: now, the filter deletes nothing, but puts
mail from unknown people in a separate folder, which I check
when I feel like it (not necessarily very often). The filter
also sends back a note that tells what happened.  (Read the <a
href="mailfilter.html">description of the filter</a>, if you're
curious about it.)


<p>I don't engage in e-mail bombs (sending many large or mails to the same
address) or other forms of Internet terrorism. I don't even suggest
other do. On the contrary, I react with hostility to people who suggest
such things. Most of them are just ignorant, but that is not an excuse.
Network abuse is network abuse, regardless of why you do it. If you send
a mail bomb, you deserve to get thrown out of the net. Period. 

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>I like to keep my private stuff private.  If you can, please do PGP encrypt
your mail to me (you can download my PGP public key 
<a href="lars-public-key.asc">directly</a> or from the
<a href="http://www.pgp.net/pgpnet/">key servers</a>). 

<p>Please also PGP sign your letters, because Netscape made
forging the sender trivial and popular.

<h2>The address</h2>

<p>My personal e-mail address is liw@iki.fi.  Other addresses may or may 
not work.  MIME is OK. My home page is at
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/liw/">http://www.iki.fi/liw/</a>.

<p>Articles meant for comp.os.linux.announce should be sent
to linux-announce@news.ornl.gov, not to my personal address.
The address must be in the To: or Cc: header. I reserve the
right to ignore any articles sent via mailing lists or with Bcc:. News
programs can usually send it to the correct address. See also <a
href="http://www.iki.fi/liw/linux/cola.html">the comp.os.linux.announce
home page</a>.
