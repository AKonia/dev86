============================================
I've made a load of changes to this code, but there's still a lot to be done.
- scanf, fscanf




input, file positioning, eof, declarations of functions, printf

look for unsigned char references

specifically
fix printf and figure out what's going on in there.
write idealgetline, scanf, other stuff
then deal with above stuff...


LATEST LIST:
printf, fprintf
scanf, fscanf
feof
seek support
error handling (not too hard since system calls only in a few places)
atexit stuff (close files; will need to add a linked list of files)
setvbuf if desired
check that fopen() and stdio_init() fill in ALL the fields
testing!
