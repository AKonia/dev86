Error checking is known to be wanting.  However the author just wants to
get it working right now.

fread() and fwrite() are not supported.  open(), read(), write(), and close()
work very well for binary data.

fopen() is the only way to open a file.  None of the temp stuff is supported,
and frepon() is unsupported.

GNU extensions are unsupported.

Some printf specifications may not work.  Read the code for details of what
IS supported.

Other than that, this should be a perfectly normal stdio lib when it's finished.
