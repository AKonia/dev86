--------------------------------
1) i386 is always under lib

*) BCC_DIR == /  -->  add to paths for Native

*) BCC_DIR == /usr		--> Non-native
*) BCC_DIR == /usr/local	--> Non-native

*) BCC_DIR == ''		--> Like Native, not "/usr"
*) BCC_DIR == . 		--> Like Native, uses pwd.

   DOS or build dir.
   Instead of /usr add the current path to bcc less the exe name and
   the last piece IF it's /bin. The paths with and without /bin are
   both added to the exe list (/bin first).

   POSS: If exe is a symlink add both before and after, after first.

*) BCC_DIR is an env var who's existance overrides built in.
*)  --> No need for ncc, it's same as BCC_DIR="" bcc

--------------------------------

Remove default_libdir[03]
Add default_libdir and default_libsuffix.
