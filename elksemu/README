Elksemu is an emulator for the environment that elks will provide on a
real ELKS machine. The emulator only runs on linux-i386 or similar.

If your kernel version is 1.2.13 then apply the patch in the Kernel_patch
file. 

If you're using one of the 2.0.X series then the binfmt_elks.c module
should be able to compile and install. BUT do note you need the modules
and probably modversions options and you _may_ have to alter the compile
command to match those seen when you compile modules that come with the
kernel.

If you're using a 2.1.43 or later then the binfmt_misc driver is in
the stock kernel add the following line to a /etc/rc*/* file and
you don't need to install a patch or module!

echo ':i86-elks:M::\x01\x03\x00\x20:\xff\xff\x83\xff:/lib/elksemu:' \
     > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

(NB I'm not running 2.1.X so I haven't tested the binfmt_misc method
    as of 26/7/97)
