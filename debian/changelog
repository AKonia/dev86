elks (0.0.7-1) unstable;urgency=medium

  * Distribution from linux.mit.edu/pub/ELKS/Dev86 taken and customized
    for debian
  * Added manpages from FreeBSD (might not be totally up to date)
  * I hope elks will enable the debian project to build the bootloader
    syslinux under Linux and no longer under DOS.
