This is a development environment for ELKS-86

You have to do make install as root
Or:

$ make bcc
$ su -c "make install-bcc"
$ make library
$ su -c "make install-lib"
$ make elksemu
$ su -c "make install-emu"
$ make tests

All from the top directory.
Once this is done new files will be /lib/elksemu, /usr/bcc/* and /usr/bin/bcc

The bcc command defaults to using /usr/bcc/include and /usr/bcc/lib. Beware
that /usr/bcc/include is a symlink into this directory.

It is now also possible to make libc.a versions for MSDOS and a more compact
version with 'CALLER_SAVES' and 'FIRST_ARG_IN_AX'. "Make install-lib2" does
this and 'bcc -Md x.c -o x.com" or "bcc x.c -Mf x.c -o x" uses the libs.

The as86 and ld86 with this are _different_ from the ones needed for the
linux-i386 kernel but can replace them, the kernel-i386 ones _will_ _not_
work correctly here!

To compile the various tools as Linux-8086 binaries cd into the relevent
directory and do a "make clean ; make" from there, note you'll have to
do "ld" before "as". Currently bcc won't work this way.

I _strongly_ suggest you install the kernel patch or load the module in
the elksemu directory in your Linux-i386 kernel, it makes things _much_
easier.
