For version 0.0.7.

I've been making quite a few changes to the assembler:
   The 'include' or 'get' command now works.
   The '-b' and '-s' options are now quite useful for bootblocks
      or encapsulated code.
   The standard input is now a valid source for the assemble
      (but only on 'big' machines).
   Various other functions now work, macros, 'jmp near',
      'jmpi qword $100000,$1000', and other bug fixes.
   As86_encap script added.
   Some of the 256 char line limits have been removed for non-bcc compiles.

The linker will now fail more gracefully for reversed 'org's and complain
about too large segments.

Bcc-cc1 will now compile under itself, with some limitations, and appears
to generate correct output.  There are problems tho in that I think the
heap<->stack saftey margin is too short and I've disconnected all code for
floating point features.

The components will all compile and seem to work quite well using MSC 5.1
under dos and will probably compile using other dos compilers. BCC cannot
compile itself under dos because the libs to fake the unix syscalls under
dos are currently too large.

A number of fixes have been added that were apperently in another version
of the tools to aid operation on other machines, there's now a better chance
of these programs working on 'big-endian' machines.

Various bits and pieces have been added to the libs, including some time
functions (but these need a _small_ way of dealing with "DST").
