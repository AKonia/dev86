Sorry silly little Robert has lost his changes file; so I'll have to do this
from the diff ...

libbsd:  Some bsd style stuff from Rick Sladkey, <jrs@world.std.com>

There's now a module for Linux-i386 > 1.3.? to allow auto loading of elksemu

The BCC tools will now compile using MSC 5.1, mail me if you'd like the BINs

BCC has a new keyword 'asm(str)' the constant string argument is passed to
the assembler; (Daniel Horak <horak20@hermes.zcu.cz>)

All assmenbler that isn't generated by BCC is marked in the *.s by special
comment lines.

BCC default arguments have been slightly modified again.
   bcc -o x x.c 	# Linux executable
   bcc -Mf -o x x.c 	# Linux executable using caller saves and AX.
   bcc -Md -o x x.c 	# MSDOS COM executable
The default CPU is always 8086.

Elksemu can (possibly should) now be run suid-root it can then honour suid
and execute only executables.  Check elksemu/Security.

Problem with ELKSemu signal handling fixed, if process was started with
disabled signals it thought they were SIG_DFL.

More functions added to libc,
   __get_es, __get_cs, __strchr_es and friends.
   dos_stat.c, dos_isatty.c dos_segalloc, dos_segfree,

Stdio1 has been removed, It was rather buggy and some people have had problems
because of this. Joel, am I going to get another version ?

Setvbuf added to stdio2, humm Y'd I miss it ?

Some process group functions added.

Quite a few direct system calls have been added to syscall.dat - but there's
no support for them in ELKSemu :-(

Bug in return value from __lseek corrected.

cfmakeraw added.

-Rob.
