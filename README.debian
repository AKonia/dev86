ELKS for Debian
---------------
All the binaries have been precompile for you and installed with the
package. For reference/Documentation purposes the complete sourcecode
is included which you are looking at right now.

Read the Documentation in this directory to get you going with ELKS.

There are also manpages for 

as86, ld86, bcc, bcc-cc1 and dis88 included but they might not be current
since they come from bcc for FreeBSD.
